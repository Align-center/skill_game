To Try the game two options :
    -You only open the game.html file and play but nothing happen when you win
    -You configure your database and local server to save your times to do so :

First of all make sure you have a local server and a database management system (MAMP, WAMP & XAMP are local servers with build-in DBMS PHPMyAdmin)
Once you have this modify the index.php file (line 8 to 14) with your username and id to access the database
That's it, you can now play and save your times !
